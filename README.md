ShaderToy to ShaderLab Converter

If you’ve tried dabbling with shaders at all, you’ve probably come across ShaderToy – an online shader showcase with some pretty amazing examples of what’s possible in a few lines of shader code, inspired greatly by classic demoscene coding. Here’s just two examples: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dl3zn

It’s an amazing resource, not only for inspiration but for learning how to create shaders, since every example comes with full source code which you can edit and immediately test online in your browser, alter parameters, supply different inputs etc.

The shaders exhibited on ShaderToy are exclusively written in GLSL, and run in your browser using WebGL.I write an automatic conversion tool to turn a GLSL shader into an HLSL shader that help you fast convert ShaderToy to ShaderLab unity.
